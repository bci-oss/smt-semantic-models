In the following only deviations from IDTA-02006-3-0 are documented:

### Added

* added preferred names. Attention: they are not yet aligned with the names as defined in the IEC CDD dictionary or ECLASS
* added some German descriptions and preferred names
		
### Changed

* descriptions changed conformant to [SAMM best practices](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/best-practices.html), i.e. start with captial letter and end with period.

### Removed

* SMT attribute _Nameplate/AssetSpecificProperties_ is not contained since it is generic: if needed the property can be added with defined SAMM properties as needed.
